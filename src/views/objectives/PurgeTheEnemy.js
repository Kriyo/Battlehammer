            scores 3 VP for every CHARACTER that is destroyed; if your opponent
            has less than 5 CHARACTER models then youâ€™re effectively reducing
            your potential by 3 VP per missing target.

            scores 2 VP or 3 VP per MONSTER or VEHICLE model destroyed; the
            value depends on whether the target has a Wounds characteristic of
            11 or more.

            gives you 10 VP if you destroy on TITANIC model, or 15 if you
            destroy two or more.

          <p>
            gives you 6 VP if the enemy WARLORD is destroyed; by taking this
            objective you immediately sacrifice 9 potential victory points.
