### Pretty quick

It should be pretty quick as it's small data so it's persisted locally on the device, no API fetching or DBs involved. Also holds onto your game until you decide to end it.

## Some of the nicer things on the way

- Persist Dark / Light theme
- Make the objectives more dynamic and allow the user to select via predefined dropdown rather than a text input.
- Add more info about primary objectives and missions.
